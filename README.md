# [SHALMANESER - A Shallow Semantic Parser](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/shal/)

## Description

Shalmaneser is a supervised learning toolbox for shallow semantic parsing, i.e. the automatic assignment of semantic classes and roles to text. The system was developed for Frame Semantics; thus we use Frame Semantics terminology and call the classes frames and the roles frame elements. However, the architecture is reasonably general, and with a certain amount of adaption, Shalmaneser should be usable for other paradigms (e.g., PropBank roles) as well. Shalmaneser caters both for end users, and for researchers.

For end users, we provide a simple end user mode which can simply apply the pre-trained classifiers for English (FrameNet annotation / Collins parser) and German (SALSA Frame annotation / Sleepy parser). For researchers interested in investigating shallow semanticparsing, our system is extensively configurable and extendable.
