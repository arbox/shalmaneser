# Features

# bag-of-words context, with given context size,
# for example:
 feature = context 50
 feature = context 2
#
# (you can give more than one context feature line!)
#
# other possible features:
# feature = syntax
# feature = synsem
#
# syntax: grammatical functions
# synsem: grammatical functions plus headwords

#feature = context % %contextsize%
feature = syntax

# How to handle training data that is labeled
# with multiple sense labels?
# - binarize (default): This works only with binary classifiers. 
#   When featurizing for the binary classifiers, consider an item 
#   positive if its set of assigned labels includes the 
#   label for this binary classifier.
# - repeat: Repeat the instance, once for each
#   sense label that has been assigned. (Basically, treat it
#   as N instances with equal features but different labels.)
# - join: join all the assigned senses into one combined sense
#   and treat that as a separate sense to train on.
# - keep: keep as multiple sense labels. (Note that this
#   makes sense only for classifiers that can deal with
#   multiple labels.)

#handle_multilabel = binarize
handle_multilabel = repeat

# What to do with numerical features?
# - keep: just leave as is
# - repeat: for a feature with max. numerical value N,
#   use N binary features
# - bin: use a fixed number of bins, e.g. 5, then
#   if feature value > 20: set all bins to 1,
#   if feature value > 10: set the first four bins to 1, 
#   etc.
#   default: bin.

# Binary classifiers, or n-ary classifiers?
# if binary classifiers, set 'binary_classifiers = true'
# default is 'false'.
