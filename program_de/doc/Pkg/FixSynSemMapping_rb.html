FixSynSemMapping: Given a SalsaTigerRegXML sentence with semantic role
annotation, simplify the mapping of semantic roles to syntactic
constituents
</p>
<p>
The following is lifted from the LREC06 paper on Shalmaneser: During
preprocessing, the span of semantic roles in the training corpora is 
projected onto the output of the syntactic parser by assigning each role to
the set of maximal constituents covering its word span. f the word span of
a role does not coincide with parse tree constituents, e.g. due to
misparses, the role is ``spread out&#8217;&#8217; across several
constituents. This leads to idiosyncratic paths between predicate and
semantic role in the parse tree. 
</p>
<p>
[The following span standardization algorithm is used to make the
syntax-semantics mapping more uniform:] Given a role r that has been
assigned, let N be the set of terminal nodes of the syntactic structure
that are covered by r. 
</p>
<pre>
  Iteratively compute the maximal projection of N in the syntactic
  structure: 
  1) If n is a node such that all of n's children are in N,
    then remove n's children from N and add n instead.
  2) If n is a node with 3 or more children, and all of n's
    children except one are in N, then remove n's children from N
    and add n instead. 
  3) If n is an NP with 2 children, and one of them, another NP,
    is in N, and the other, a relative clause, is not, then remove
    n's children from N and add n instead.

  If none of the rules is applicable to N anymore, assign r to the
  nodes in N.
</pre>
<p>
Rule 1 implements normal maximal projection. Rule 2 ``repairs&#8217;&#8217;
parser errors where all children of a node but one have been assigned the
same role. Rule 3 addresses a problem of the FrameNet data, where relative
clauses have been omitted from roles assigned to NPs.
