SalsaTigerRegXML.rb

Katrin Erk, June 2005

<p>
Classes for accessing and managing  SalsaTigerXML sentences
</p>
<p>
The interface of the classes in this package is similar to that of
SalsaTigerXML.rb but the package is based solely on regular expressions and
not on REXML.
</p>
<p>
Main class here: <a
href="../SalsaTigerSentence.html">SalsaTigerSentence</a>, keeps a complete
sentence
</p>
<p>
Nodes of the syntactic tree, frames and frame elements are all handed
around as <a href="../XMLNode.html">XMLNode</a> objects, or more
specifically  <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a>, <a
href="../FrameNode.html">FrameNode</a> and <a
href="../FeNode.html">FeNode</a> objects, respectively. 
</p>
<p>
Inheritance between classes in here:
</p>
<pre>
                 GraphNode
                   |
                 XMLNode
                   |
               SalsaTigerXmlNode
               /                 \
             SynNode            SemNode
              |                 /     \
           TSSynNode      FrameNode   FeNode
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../SalsaTigerSentence.html">SalsaTigerSentence</a> uses the other
classes, but is separate
</p>
<p>
<a href="../SalsaTigerSentence.html">SalsaTigerSentence</a> does
<em>not</em> yield a faithful image of the SalsaTiger XML structure of  a
sentence. With the SalsaTiger XML structure you need to follow
&#8220;idref&#8221; attributes to the elements with matching
&#8220;id&#8221; attributes in other parts of the structure. With the
classes in this package, you don&#8217;t.  Wherever in SalsaTiger XML you
have an idref, you will have _direct access to the  object_ here. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose that in the XML structure you have a nonterminal element X with
<edge> elements pointing to other (terminal or nonterminal) elements X1,..,
Xn. Then you&#8217;ll have  a <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> object
N that contains X as its XML object, and the children N1,..,Nn of N  will
be <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> objects that contain X1,..,Xn as
their XML objects.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> that is a terminal may have
children too: its splitword parts (if any).
</p>
<p>
So: a syntactic node is a <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> object, its
children are <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> objects. The edges to
its children are labeled the same way as in the XML structure. If the
children are splitword parts, the edges are unlabeled.
</p>
<p>
A frame is a <a href="../FrameNode.html">FrameNode</a> object, its children
are <a href="../FeNode.html">FeNode</a> objects. The edges to its children
are labeled with the <a href="../FE.html">FE</a> name or with
&#8220;target&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
A frame element is an <a href="../FeNode.html">FeNode</a> object, its
children are <a href="../SynNode.html">SynNode</a> objects. The edges to
its children are unlabeled.
</p>
<p>
A frame underspecification is an <a href="../UspNode.html">UspNode</a>
object, its children are <a href="../FrameNode.html">FrameNode</a> objects.
The edges to its children are unlabeled.
</p>
<p>
A frame element underspecification is an <a
href="../UspNode.html">UspNode</a> objects, its children are <a
href="../FeNode.html">FeNode</a> objects. The edges to its children are
unlabeled.
