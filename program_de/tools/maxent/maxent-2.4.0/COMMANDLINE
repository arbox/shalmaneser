To convert Maxent 1.0 models to a new format:

java opennlp.maxent.io.OldFormatGISModelReader old_model_prefix new_model_name

The new model name is case sensitive, so if you put something like
"mymodel.bin.gz" it will save it as a gzipped binary file, whereas
"mymodel.txt" will save it as a plain text file that you can inspect
more easily (but of course take more disk space).

An an example, I needed to convert the Maxent 1.0 model for part of
speech tagging to a new single file format. The model was broken into
two pieces, EnglishPOS.mei.gz and EnglishPOS.mep.gz.  I wanted to
create a new file that was gzipped and binary, so this was the
form of the command:

java opennlp.maxent.io.OldFormatGISModelReader EnglishPOS EnglishPOS.bin.gz


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To convert between different formats of the new style:

java opennlp.maxent.io.SuffixSensitiveGISModelReader old_model_name new_model_name

For example, to convert a model called "model.bin.gz" (which is thus
saved in gzipped binary format) to one in (unzipped) text format:

java opennlp.maxent.io.SuffixSensitiveGISModelReader model.bin.gz model.txt

This particular example would of course be useful when you want to
create models which take up less space (.bin.gz), but then need to
inspect a few of them as plain text files.
