/**
 * This interface specifies language/treebank specific information for a
 * Treebank, which a parser or other treebank user might need to know. <p>
 * <p/>
 * Some of this is fixed for a (treebank,language) pair, but some of it
 * reflects feature extraction decisions, so it can be sensible to have
 * multiple implementations of this interface for the same
 * (treebank,language) pair. <p>
 * <p/>
 * So far this covers punctuation, character encodings, and characters
 * reserved for label annotations.  It should probably be expanded to
 * cover other stuff (unknown words?). <p>
 * <p/>
 * Various methods in this class return arrays.  You should treat them
 * as read-only, even though one cannot enforce that in Java. <p>
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of this method do not call basicCategory() on arguments
 * before testing them, so if needed, you should explicitly call
 * basicCategory() yourself before passing arguments to these routines for
 * testing.
